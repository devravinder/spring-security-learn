1. Generating Private & Public Keys
   ```shell
    openssl genrsa -out private.key 2048
    openssl rsa -in private.key -pubout -out public.key
   ```
   or
    ```shell
    openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out private.key -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:4096
    openssl rsa -pubout -in private.key -out public.key
    ```


2. In this project we are using the same application as authorization server & resource server.
   1. in some projects, authorization server & resource server are different applications.
   2. if one application is just resource server, then jwt encoder is not required.

3. Usage  
   so:
   1. to get the token,
      - call api '/token' with http basic credentials ( username:password )
      ```shell
       curl -u user:password http://localhost:8080/token
      ```
   2. use the token for other requests
      ```shell
       curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" http://localhost:8080/message
      ```
